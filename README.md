## MCP Observability
A POC that explores the Model Context Provider (MCP) architecture to combine and correlate different sources of observability data (logs, metrics, alerts and incidents) for intelligent alerting and automated root cause analysis (RCA) in observability systems.

For this POC, we will refer to this [docs](https://docs.mistral.ai/agents/mcp/) to setup the server and client to integrate with the Mistral API.

### Server
For the server implementation, we will be defining the following methods:
1. Ingest data from multiple datasources and enrich them with system context.
2. Store the enriched data as unified MCP documents for downstream consumption by clients.

The server will expose an API endpoint to serve unified, structured data to the client. This data is transformed into MCP documents containing relevant context.

### Client
For the client implementation, we will implement the following functions:

1. Fetch data from the MCP API
    - Query incident contexts by service, time, or alert type.
    - Query relationship mappings to understand how alerts, metrics, and logs are inter-connected.

2. Send the data to the LLM for analysis
    - Summarize alerts and incidents.
    - Perform RCA by correlating incidents, alerts, metrics, and logs.
    - Recommend actionable solutions for each incident/alert.
